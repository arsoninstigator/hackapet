# cemetery crawler !
cemetery crawler is my submission for hack club's hackapet ysws. it's a small pixel-art arcade game that's set in the abandoned cemetery on a dimly lit night. my "pet" is a grim reaper present in the cemetery and the player is supposed to control him and **collect wandering souls** while **avoiding vengeful spirits.**

## controls 
- left – move left <br>
- right – move right <br>
- reap – swing scythe to collect souls & banish hostile spirits <br>

## gameplay
- view: third-person, side-scrolling cemetery (reaper in the center, background scrolls). 
- game setting base: the cemetery scrolls infinitely, with obstacles like tombstones and fog patches to avoid. 
- souls float across the screen—walk into them to collect. 
- hostile spirits charge at you—use the reap button to dispel them before they hit! 
- occasionally, a golden soul appears—catching it slows time or grants temporary invincibility. 
- the game speeds up as time progresses, making dodging and reaping more challenging as you move up levels.

## win/loss condition
- win: high score based on the number of souls collected.
- lose: if hit by hostile spirits too many times.

## graphics
the game has a low-res pixel art style and the pixel art for this was made with a combination of aseprite (windows) and resprite (android)
- background: dark, misty cemetery with shifting weather.
- reaper: small hooded figure seen from behind, scythe swinging in hand.
- souls: wispy blue/white; golden for power-ups.
- hostile spirits: red/purple glowing figures with sharp, jagged outlines.
